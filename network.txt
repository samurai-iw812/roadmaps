🟢 Stage 1 — The Basics (Weeks 1–4)

When you start learning networking, you need to understand the core ideas first.
Forget memorizing — just try to visualize how data moves from one device to another.

Topics to learn:

What is a network? (LAN, WAN, MAN)

What are Hosts, Switches, Routers, and IPs?

The OSI Model (7 layers) and TCP/IP Model (4 layers).

IP Addressing (IPv4, basic idea of IPv6).

Subnetting (how networks are divided).

Important protocols: ARP, ICMP, DNS, DHCP.

Free resources:

YouTube: search “OSI model explained easy” or “IP addressing for beginners.”

Cisco NetAcad (free registration) for basic networking courses.

Websites like GeeksforGeeks or FreeCodeCamp (networking section).

Practice ideas:

Use ping, ipconfig or ifconfig, and traceroute.

Try to draw a simple LAN with 3 PCs and one router.

Calculate subnets for small networks (like /24 → /26).

🟡 Stage 2 — Switching & Routing (Weeks 5–8)

Now it’s time to understand how data moves inside a network.
Switches connect devices inside a LAN, and routers connect different networks.

Topics to focus on:

VLANs and trunking (how to split a network virtually).

Static routing vs Dynamic routing.

Intro to routing protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP (basic idea).

NAT and PAT (how private IPs connect to the internet).

Free tools to use:

🧩 Cisco Packet Tracer — amazing free tool to simulate networks.

🧠 GNS3 — for advanced simulations.

🦈 Wireshark — to analyze packets and understand what’s happening.

Practice idea:

Create 3 VLANs in Packet Tracer, and make routing between them.

Capture packets with Wireshark and analyze DHCP or DNS requests.

🔵 Stage 3 — Network Services (Weeks 9–12)

At this point, you should understand how basic services work on a network.

Learn about:

DHCP (automatic IP assignment).

DNS (domain name to IP).

HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS.

SSH, FTP, SMTP (basic understanding).

Client-server model vs Peer-to-Peer.

Mini projects:

Set up a small DHCP and DNS server in a virtual lab.

Create a simple HTTP server on Linux using Python or Apache.

Use Wireshark to see a DNS request in action.

🔒 Stage 4 — Network Security (Weeks 13–16)

This is where networking meets cybersecurity.
You’ll learn how to secure your connections and understand attacks.

Main topics:

Firewalls (and how rules work).

ACLs (Access Control Lists).

IDS/IPS basics.

VPNs (IPSec, SSL).

Network scanning & analysis tools.

Free tools:

🧰 Nmap — scan networks and discover devices.

🦈 Wireshark — packet analysis.

🔐 pfSense — open-source firewall to play with.

Practice idea:

Run a safe local Nmap scan on your own network.

Create simple firewall rules and test connectivity.

🧱 Stage 5 — Advanced Networking & Cloud (Weeks 17–24)

When you’re comfortable with the basics, move into modern topics.

Learn about:

BGP (routing between ISPs).

SDN (Software Defined Networking).

Network Automation (using Python + Ansible).

Cloud Networking (AWS, Azure, GCP — focus on VPCs and subnets).

Docker & Kubernetes networking (basic idea).

Projects:

Write a Python script using netmiko to connect to a router and pull info.

Create a small virtual network inside AWS free tier.

🧠 Stage 6 — Practice, Document & Grow (Continuous)

Networking is all about hands-on experience.
Don’t just read — build, break, fix, repeat.

What to do:

Build mini labs in Packet Tracer or GNS3 every week.

Document your setups in a GitHub repo (with screenshots).

Join networking communities (Reddit, Discord, or forums).

Learn from mistakes — that’s how you really grow.

Certifications (optional but helpful):

CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate).

CompTIA Network+.
You can find free study materials and videos for both on YouTube.

🧩 Recommended Free Tools & Platforms

Cisco Packet Tracer — simulation.

Wireshark — packet analysis.

GNS3 / EVE-NG — advanced labs.

VirtualBox — to build test environments.

FreeCodeCamp, YouTube, and Coursera (audit mode) — free courses.

💬 My Notes

Learning networking changed how I see computers.
It’s not just about connecting cables — it’s about understanding how every single packet finds its way.
Once you understand networks, cybersecurity becomes 10x easier.

So yeah, this roadmap is what I’m following, all free, all practical, and 100% written by me 💪🐧
