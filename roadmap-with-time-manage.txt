1. Understand the Basics
Before diving into bug bounty hunting, familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of cybersecurity and web application security.

Key Topics:
Cybersecurity Fundamentals : Learn about threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors.
Web Application Security : Understand how web applications work, including HTTP/HTTPS, cookies, sessions, and APIs.
OWASP Top 10 : Study the most critical web application security risks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF).
Resources:
OWASP Web Security Testing Guide: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/
PortSwigger Web Security Academy: https://portswigger.net/web-security


2. Learn Core Skills
Develop the technical skills required for bug bounty hunting.

a. Programming Languages
JavaScript : Essential for understanding client-side vulnerabilities like XSS.
Python : Useful for scripting and automating tasks.
PHP/Java/.NET : Familiarize yourself with server-side languages commonly used in web applications.
b. Networking
Understand TCP/IP, DNS, SSL/TLS, and how data flows over the internet.
Learn tools like curl, nmap, and Wireshark.
c. Operating Systems
Gain hands-on experience with Linux (Kali, Ubuntu) and Windows.
Learn basic commands and system configurations.
d. Version Control
Understand Git and GitHub for managing code and collaborating with others.


3. Master Vulnerability Discovery
Learn how to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities.

a. Common Vulnerabilities
SQL Injection : Manipulate database queries to extract or modify data.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) : Inject malicious scripts into web pages.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) : Trick users into performing unintended actions.
Path Traversal : Access restricted files or directories.
Remote Code Execution (RCE) : Execute arbitrary code on the server.
Broken Authentication : Exploit weak session management or password reset mechanisms.
Insecure Deserialization : Manipulate serialized objects to execute malicious code.
b. Tools for Vulnerability Discovery
Burp Suite : Intercept and analyze HTTP requests.
sqlmap : Automate SQL injection testing.
ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) : Scan for vulnerabilities.
Nmap : Discover open ports and services.
Dirb/Dirbuster : Find hidden directories and files.

4. Develop Exploitation Skills
Once you can identify vulnerabilities, learn how to exploit them effectively.

a. Manual Exploitation
Practice exploiting vulnerabilities manually using tools like Burp Suite and sqlmap.
Write custom payloads for XSS, CSRF, and other attacks.
b. Automation
Use Python or Bash to automate repetitive tasks.
Build scripts for scanning, fuzzing, and exploiting vulnerabilities.
c. Post-Exploitation
Learn how to maintain access after gaining initial entry.
Explore privilege escalation techniques.


5. Join Bug Bounty Platforms
Start participating in bug bounty programs to gain real-world experience.

Popular Platforms:
